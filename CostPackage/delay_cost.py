        aircraft_type: str

        passengers: int | str = None
            int is provided means passengers number,
            actual number of passengers boarded on the aircraft,
            when not provided the base scenario for passengers number will be considered
            str is provided means passengers scenario,
            "low" 65% of seats capacity: 
            "base" 80% of seats capacity is the normal scenario (most common)
            "high" 95% of seats capacity
            for wide-body aircraft the capacity is set to 85%
        is_low_cost_airline: bool=None
            boolean value set to true if airline is Low-Cost Carrier (LCC), if true
            sets all the cost scenarios to low
        flight_length: float=None
            Length of flight in kilometers to calculate the type of haul
            (actual fuel costs can be calculated only if provided)
        destination_airport: str=None
            ICAO code of airport of arrival
        crew_costs: float | str =None
            float value means costs of entire crew (pilots and cabin crew) in EUR/min
            str value represents the crew costs scenario which can be either "low", "base" or "high"
            "low" means zero EUR/min costs for the entire crew
            "base" is the normal scenario (most common)
            "high" is the expensive scenario
        maintenance_costs: float | str = None
            float value means costs expressed in EUR/min
            (ATTENTION tactical maintenance costs may be very different at the various flight phases)
            str value represents the maintenance costs scenario which can be either "low", "base" or "high"
            depending on aircraft age, maintenance status etc.
            "low" can be applied for example on newer aircraft or if ordinary maintenance was recently made
            "base"
            "base" is the normal scenario (most common)
            "high" is the expensive scenario (e.g. old aircraft or expensive tactical maintenance)

             list of tuples. Each tuple represents one passenger,

             The delay threshold is the time at which the passenger misses the connection.
             The delay perceived is the delay at the passenger final destination,
             generally computed considering the next available flight of the same airline which carries
